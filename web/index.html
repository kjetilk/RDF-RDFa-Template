<h1>RDFa Templating</h1>

<h2>Status of this document</h2>

<p>
This is at present a braindump of an idea I had to extend RDFa to use
as a templating language for building web pages. It is not by any
means finished but does have a partial implementation in the Perl
distribution <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/RDF-RDFa-Template/">RDF::RDFa::Template</a>. First
and foremost, this document and the module serves as a starting point
for further discussion.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> is a W3C
Recommendation for embedding <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>
in XHTML.  Since RDF represents structured data, we can utilise it to
represent both invariant data and variables. The invariant data can be
used to control a backend web application. By connecting invariant
data and variables, data we wish to use to populate a document can be
retrieved. This is the motivation for a new templating language,
<em>RDFa&nbsp;Templates</em>.
</p>
<p>
We note that RDF and RDFa alike can contain an <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/#dfn-rdf-XMLLiteral">XML
Literal</a>, which is a balanced XML fragment. This makes it possibly
to legally encode XML fragments into the RDF model, that can represent
e.g. variables. Thus, by parsing the XHTML, an RDF Model can be
built. By parsing any XML Literals of a specified namespace, special
constructs, such as <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL</a> variables,
can be found, thus creating a Basic Graph Pattern.  There is therefore
a design goal of RDFa Templates that it should be parseable with
standard XML, RDFa and RDF tools with very few extensions. It is not a
goal to make the templating language be RDFa, it is more important
that template writers feel at home with current their HTML/XML-centric
world.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the document will be divided into parts by wrapping the
part in a <code>graph</code> element. Each section is an RDF graph and
it is <a href="http://buzzword.org.uk/2009/rdfa4/spec">planned</a>
that the author will have different ways to name this graph, but in
the example implementation it is very limited, see
below. Configuration information can be supplied as attributes to the
<code>graph</code> element.
 
</p>
<p>
Two modes of operation is envisioned:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The RDF graph is used to create the WHERE clause of a SPARQL
  query. XML Literals are parsed to find the SPARQL variables as well
  as other constructs, such as FILTERs. Configuration information,
  such as the URL of a SPARQL Endpoint is retrieved from the
  <code>graph</code> element. The query is then executed and variables
  are populated by iterating over the results.</li>
  <li>The RDFa Template is used in a Model-View-Controller paradigm
  framework. The RDF model is submitted to a Controller, which is free
  to process it as it sees fit, and the corresponding View should
  return the variables that the template asks for.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Retrieve a single record</h3>
<p>


The concept can be best explained by example. Consider the following
extended XHTML+RDFa document:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:g="http://example.org/graph#"
      xmlns:rat="http://www.kjetil.kjernsmo.net/software/rat/xmlns"
      xmlns:sub="http://www.kjetil.kjernsmo.net/software/rat/substitutions#"
      xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
      xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
      xmlns:dbp="http://dbpedia.org/property/"
      rat:doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN"
      rat:doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd"
      xml:lang="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Range of a Cessna Citation Mustang&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;h1>Range of a Cessna Citation Mustang&lt;/h1>
    &lt;rat:graph g:graph="query1" endpoint="http://dbpedia.org/sparql">
      &lt;div about="sub:resource">
	&lt;div property="rdfs:label">Cessna Citation Mustang&lt;/div>
	&lt;div property="dbp:rangeAlt" datatype="rdf:XMLLiteral">&lt;rat:variable name="sub:range"/>&lt;/div>
      &lt;/div>
    &lt;/rat:graph>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>


<p>
Let us walk through the example: It first defines the needed namespace
prefixes, and sets the document language. Two namespaces are defined
for use by RDFa Templates: Here, the namespace assigned to the
<code>rat:</code>-prefix is used for the XML elements and attributes
used inline in the XHTML document, whereas <code>sub:</code> is used
to prefix the document author's variables, so that each variable is
denoted by a URI. It has also two attributes to set the document type
of the result document. In the current implementation, these prefixes
are hardcoded in the code, but this will change in upcoming releases.
</p>

<p>
The <code>rat:graph</code> element delimits a named graph. It can be
understood as a unit that may result in a single query in the first
usage scenario above. Let us in the following consider only this case,
the processing in the second usage scenario is very much up to the
backend.
</p>

<p>
The <code>g:graph</code> attribute causes a named graph to be created,
using the base URI of the document and the attribute content as a
fragment identifier. All triples that has a predicate within this
element will be added to this graph. It is important to understand the
the named graph is used to refer to the graph in the context of the
document, but it is not necessarily used in any generated SPARQL
query. In the current implementation, the namespace URI and qname of
this attribute is hardcoded, so it must be used in any experiments,
but this will change in a full implementation of the ideas in this
document.
</p>
<p>
The element then has an optional <code>endpoint</code> attribute,
which contains the URL of the SPARQL endpoint that the query that
stems from the triples of that particular graph will be run against.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the triples that make out the query. This examples says "give
me the URI and the <code>rdfs:comment</code> where the
<code>rdfs:label</code> is 'Resource Description Framework' written in English".
</p>
<p>
Specifically, this SPARQL query will be generated:
</p>
<pre>
SELECT * WHERE { 
  ?resource &lt;http://dbpedia.org/property/rangeAlt> ?range .
  ?resource &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> "Cessna Citation Mustang"@en . 
}

</pre>

<!-- p>
Lets look more carefully into what happened here: First, the namespace
declarations of the original document were added to the query, except
the XHTML namespace and the two RDFa Template-specific namespaces,
since they are known to not influence the generation of the
query. Then, the two variables declared in the
<code>sub:</code>-prefixed namespace were added to the SELECT
clause. 
</p -->
<p>
We note that in the original file "<code>sub:resource</code>"
was the subject set by the <code>about</code> attribute, and this has
resulted in the <code>?resource</code> variable being the subject in
the SPARQL WHERE clause. The two <code>property</code> attributes sets
the predicates. The object of the "<code>rdfs:label</code>" predicate
is a plain literal. Plain literals are used to set the object to a
specified value to be searched for. 
</p>
<p>
An XML Literal, when in the <code>rat:</code>-prefixed namespace, has
a special meaning. In this case, we see that the
<code>rat:variable</code> element is used to create the
<code>?comment</code> variable, which appears in the object of
<code>rdfs:comment</code>.
</p>

<h3>Retrieve multiple records</h3>

<p>
Often, you want to retrieve multiple records, and a processor should
iterate over all query solutions. Consider this example:

</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:rat="http://www.kjetil.kjernsmo.net/software/rat/xmlns"
      xmlns:sub="http://www.kjetil.kjernsmo.net/software/rat/substitutions#"
      xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
      xmlns:dbp="http://dbpedia.org/property/"
      xmlns:dbo="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/"
      rat:doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN"
      rat:doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd"
      xml:lang="en">
  &lt;head>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;h1>Aircraft produced in 1973&lt;/h1>
    &lt;table>
      &lt;tr>&lt;th>Name&lt;/th>&lt;th>Produced&lt;/th>&lt;th>First flight&lt;/th>&lt;/tr>
      &lt;rat:graph g:graph="query2" endpoint="http://dbpedia.org/sparql">
	&lt;tr about="sub:resource">
	  &lt;td property="foaf:name" datatype="rdf:XMLLiteral">&lt;rat:variable name="sub:name"/>&lt;/td>
	  &lt;td property="dbo:produced">1973&lt;/td>
	  &lt;td property="dbp:firstFlight" datatype="rdf:XMLLiteral">&lt;rat:variable name="sub:first"/>&lt;/td>
	&lt;/tr>
      &lt;/rat:graph>
    &lt;/table>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

<p>
In this case, we will get more than one result as the query has more
than one solution. The processor should in this case iterate over the
elements in the <code>rat:graph</code> element and insert the values
for the corresponding row on each iteration, thus producing the
following XHTML+RDFa:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd">
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"
      xmlns:dbp="http://dbpedia.org/property/"
      xmlns:dbo="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/"
      xml:lang="en">
  &lt;head>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;h1>Aircraft produced in 1973&lt;/h1>
    &lt;table>
      &lt;tr>&lt;th>Name&lt;/th>&lt;th>Produced&lt;/th>&lt;th>First flight&lt;/th>&lt;/tr>  
      &lt;tr about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dassault/Dornier_Alpha_Jet">
	&lt;td property="foaf:name">Alpha Jet&lt;/td>
	&lt;td property="dbo:produced">1973&lt;/td>
	&lt;td property="dbp:firstFlight">1973-10-26&lt;/td>
      &lt;/tr>
      &lt;tr about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_PA-36_Pawnee_Brave">
	&lt;td property="foaf:name">PA-36 Pawnee Brave&lt;/td>
	&lt;td property="dbo:produced">1973&lt;/td>
	&lt;td property="dbp:firstFlight">1969&lt;/td>
      &lt;/tr>    
    &lt;/table>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>

<p>
This is not implemented yet and the query in this example does not
anymore return any results.
</p>
<p>
We saw that by having an invariant property <code>dbo:produced</code>,
a SPARQL query was generated where this literal resulted in a query
that would find everything first produced in 1973. The
<code>sub:</code>-prefixed URIs in the input example was used to create
three variables, <code>?resource</code>, <code>?name</code> and
<code>?first</code>, which was used to populate the template.

</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
The scope of RDFa Templates is an open question. The author currently
feels that only issues relevant to RDF and SPARQL is the scope of RDFa
Templates. There are many well established and widespread templating
languages for writing web pages, e.g. in PHP, <a
href="http://template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a>, etc. Also,
for advanced transforms, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>
is a useful and widespread tool. XSLT is ill suited for working on RDF
graphs, so RDFa Templates and XSLT is a complement to each other.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the author envisions RDFa Templates as a part of a greater
system that employs several techniques to build web pages. One may for
example use Template Toolkit to build the page, insert query
variables, etc., and then use RDFa Templates to populate the page with
data from a backend.
</p>
<p>
This is, as stated, and open question, and the author is open to other
views.
</p>

<h2>Weaknesses</h2>

<p>
Currently, all variables are denoted by a specified namespace
URI. This causes that the same URI is used in different applications
for different variables. Some way for application authors to choose
this prefix, yet retain portability should be found.
</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>
This is an early draft, and there are a number of issues with this
draft, as well as the implementation. The TODO list for the software
is in the distribution, this is a list of issues with this document:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Resolve weaknesses, or decide that they are really not
important.</li>
<li>How will URIs appear in objects?</li>
<li>How to use FILTERs? (use XSPARQL?)</li>
<li>How to use freetext index matching?</li>
<li>How to create SPARQL UNIONs and OPTIONALs?</li>
<li>Other ways to assign graph names?</li>

</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>
First and foremost a thank-you to Toby Inkster for writing the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/RDF-RDFa-Parser/">RDF::RDFa::Parser</a>,
and for several suggestions in the early thinking around this idea.
