<h1>RDFa Templating</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
RDFa is a W3C Recommendation for embedding RDF in XHTML. Since a RDF
graph is expressed in the WHERE clause of SPARQL Query (with
additional syntax), the RDF graph embedded in RDFa can be used in the
WHERE clause. Also, since RDF and RDFa alike can contain an XML
Literal, which is a balanced XML fragment.
</p>
<p>
This makes it possibly to legally encode XML fragments into the RDF
model, that can represent variables, which again can be transformed to
SPARQL variables. Thus, by parsing the XHTML, the RDF model can be
built. By parsing any XML Literals of a specified namespace, special
constructs, such as SPARQL variables, can be found.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the document will be divided into parts by wrapping the
part in a <code>graph</code> element. Each section is an RDF graph,
which is identified by a <code>xml:id</code> attribute. Configuration
information can be supplied as attributes to the <code>graph</code>
element. A processor will also use the <code>xml:id</code> attribute
to name this graph.
 
</p>
<p>
Two modes of operation is imagined:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The RDF graph is used to create the WHERE clause of a SPARQL
  query. XML Literals are parsed to find the SPARQL variables as well
  as other constructs, such as FILTERs. Configuration information,
  such as the URL of a SPARQL Endpoint is retrieved from the
  <code>graph</code> element. The query is then executed and variables
  are populated by iterating over the results.</li>
  <li>The RDFa Template is used in a Model-View-Controller paradigm. The RDF model is submitted to a Controller,
