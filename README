README for RDF-RDFa-Template
----------------------------

This module is the beginning of a suggested simple RDFa-like
templating language. It is not intended to be RDFa, it is intended to
give template writers something that they are familiar with from the
XML world, yet they can use an largely unmodified XML-based
RDFa-parser to do the parsing. In this case, RDF::RDFa::Parser is
used.

For more information about the design of this templating language, see 

  http://www.kjetil.kjernsmo.net/software/rat/

BEWARE OF TODO-LIST:

This is an initial release just to enable a meaningful
discussion. Thus, there are many remaining tasks before this is a
fully functional templating system. If you start experimenting with
writing templates based on this module, it is important that you read
the TODO list in the POD of RDF::RDFa::Template.
